# week-13-FriendFinder

## Notes:

I used the sample page for most of my html and javascript in order to test out my backend code faster.  If I have the time, I want to remake the pages using my own styling and questions.

Also, right now, the list of people who answered the server lives completely in the server memory.  I plan to write the list to a file to keep the data in non-volatile storage.
